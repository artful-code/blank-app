Task: You are an expert accountant. I need your help categorizing bank transactions from a bank statement into predefined accounting categories. Each transaction contains the following details: transaction ID, value date, transaction posted date, description, Cr/Dr indicator (credit or debit), transaction amount, and available balance. Hereâ€™s what I need you to do:

1. **Classify Each Transaction**: Based on the available information, classify each transaction into one of the following categories. Use only these categories without modification:
   - Land & Building
   - Furniture
   - Computer
   - Loan to Director
   - Sale of Goods/Services
   - Interest Income
   - Other Income (including Dividend Income)
   - Cost of Services / Cost of Sales
   - Salaries and Wages
   - Bank Charges
   - Interest Expenses
   - Director Remuneration
   - Professional Charges
   - Rental & Accommodation Expense
   - Repairs & Maintenance
   - Travelling Expenses
   - Telephone Expense
   - Capital Infusion
   - Loan from Bank
   - Loan from Director
   - GST Payment
   - TDS Payment

   **Only one category should be assigned per transaction.**

2. **Extract Vendor/Customer Name**: If the description contains an indication of a vendor or customer name, extract and display it. Common patterns include "ReqPay," "IMPS," or explicit names.

3. **Use Credit/Debit Indicator**: Use the Cr/Dr indicator to aid in classification:
   - "CR" (credit) transactions may indicate income, refunds, or capital infusion.
   - "DR" (debit) transactions may suggest expenses, loan repayments, or outgoing payments.

4. **Infer Category Based on Keywords**:
   - **Assets**: Keywords like "purchase" or asset references suggest categories like "Land & Building," "Furniture," or "Computer."
   - **Loans and Infusions**: Terms like "loan" and mentions of directors or banks indicate "Loan to Director," "Loan from Bank," or "Loan from Director."
   - **Sales and Income**: Credits labeled "interest" or "sales" imply "Interest Income" or "Sale of Goods/Services."
   - **Operational Costs**: Debits related to services or costs imply "Cost of Services / Cost of Sales."
   - **Employee-Related**: "Salary" or "wage" suggests "Salaries and Wages"; "bonus" implies "Director Remuneration."
   - **Professional Services**: "Consulting" or "professional" expenses indicate "Professional Charges."
   - **Recurring Expenses**: Words like "rent," "repair," or "travel" map to categories such as "Rental & Accommodation Expense" or "Repairs & Maintenance."
   - **Tax Payments**: Explicit labels like "GST" or "TDS" should be classified as "GST Payment" or "TDS Payment."

5. **Handle Unclear Entries**: If the information in the row is insufficient for a clear categorization, make the best possible guess or label it as "Unclassified."

6. **Provide Explanations**: For each classified transaction, give a brief explanation justifying the categorization based on the description, Cr/Dr indicator, and any keywords or patterns used.

**Transaction Details**:
- **Description**: {description}
- **Credit/Debit**: {cr_dr_indicator}
